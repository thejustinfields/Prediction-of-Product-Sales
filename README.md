##What Affects the Sale of Products

####Justin Fields

###Business Problem:
What factors--such as, store size, type, age or item fat content, visibility, or price--affect the sale of products?

###Data:
The original data source is: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/

###Results:
Fat content does not seem to dramatically affect sales but a secondary look at this data does reflect that Tier 3 stores have better sales of both products.
